# Git Repositories -
- A Git repository (or repo for short) contains all of the project files and the entire revision history.
- A Git repository is a virtual storage of your project. It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed.
- It is like a folder that not only holds your files but also tracks their evolution over time.

# Types of Git Repositories -
- There are two types of Git repositories:
- **Local repository:**
          This is the copy of the repository stored on your own computer. Every time you create a Git project on your machine, itâ€™s a local repository.
- **Remote repository:**
         This is the version of the repository stored online, on a server or platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. It allows you to share your project and collaborate with others.
