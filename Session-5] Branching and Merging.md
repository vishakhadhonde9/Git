# Branching -
-  branching is a way for developers to create separate workspaces for their code without modifying the main version. Branches are pointers to a snapshot of the code, and developers can use them to add features or fix bugs. 
Here are some steps for using branches in Git:
Create a branch: Use the git branch command to create a new branch. For example, git branch testing. 
Switch to a branch: Use the git checkout command to switch to an existing branch. For example, git checkout testing. 
Make changes: Edit, stage, and commit changes to the branch. 
Push changes: Push the branch to the central repository so other developers can access it. 
Merge: When the changes are ready, merge the branch into the main branch

Here are some benefits of branching in Git:
Avoids impacting the live version: Developers can make copies of files without affecting the live version. 
Collaborates with other developers: Branches allow for easier collaboration among developers who have access to the repository. 
Saves disk space: Branches don't waste disk space like a simple file system copy would.
