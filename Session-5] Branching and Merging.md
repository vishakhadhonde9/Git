# Branching -
-  Branching is a way for developers to create separate workspaces for their code without modifying the main version.
-  Branch is a new/separate version of the main repository.
-  Branches are pointers to a snapshot of the code, and developers can use them to add features or fix bugs. 

#### 1] Create a branch: 
- Use the git branch command to create a new branch. For example, git branch testing. 
#### 2] Switch to a branch: 
- Use the git checkout command to switch to an existing branch. For example, git checkout testing. 
#### 3] Make changes: 
- Edit, stage, and commit changes to the branch. 
#### 4] Push changes: 
- Push the branch to the central repository so other developers can access it. 
#### 5] Merge: 
- When the changes are ready, merge the branch into the main branch.

# Benefits of branching in Git:
- Avoids impacting the live version: Developers can make copies of files without affecting the live version. 
- Collaborates with other developers: Branches allow for easier collaboration among developers who have access to the repository. 
- Saves disk space: Branches don't waste disk space like a simple file system copy would.
