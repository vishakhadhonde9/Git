# Version Control System -
- Version Control is a process of tracking and managing changes to source code.
- A version control system (VCS) is a tool that helps manage and track changes to a set of files over time.
- It allows multiple people to collaborate on projects, manage different versions of files, and keep a history of changes made to the files.

# Types of Version Control System -
## 1] Centralized Version Control System -
- A centralized version control system is a type of VCS where all users are working with the same central repository.
- Central Repository: Thereâ€™s one main place (a server) where all the files and their versions are stored.

- Commit: After you make changes, you "commit" (upload) those changes back to the central repository for others to access.
- Update: If someone else changes something in the central repository, you can "update" your local copy to get their changes.
- **Cons -**
  - Single Point of Failure: If the central server goes down, no one can commit or update their files.

## 2] Distributed Version Control System -
- A Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) is a system where every person working on a project has a full copy of the entire project, including its history, on their own computer.
- You can work on your own copy of the project (even offline) and make changes and When you're done, you can share your changes with others.
